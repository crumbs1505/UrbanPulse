UrbanPulse is a collaborative project I developed with a bunch of friends at a Hackathon.
The goal of UrbanPulse is to provide users with simplified data, that can help a user find out environmental metrics between different cities across the globe.

Why UrbanPulse ?
The primary goal of this project is to raise awareness among people as to how to care for their surroundings and be more conscious of their surroundings.

Future Scope of the project:

We aim to expand the project to many more factors and hope to involve IoT elements in it.

How to run the project :

1) Open the folder in Visual Studio Code
2) Ensure that you have pip and flask installed.
3) Start a virtual environment and execute the python code by executing 'python app.py' in the terminal
